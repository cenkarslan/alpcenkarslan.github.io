# Biography
I am an Assistant Professor of Intelligence and Security Studies at the Turkish National Police Academy, where I also coordinate research projects and training programs on emerging security technologies. I earned my Ph.D. in Security Strategies and Management from the Turkish National Police Academy in 2024, focusing on the security implications of techno-politics. I hold an M.A. in Intelligence Studies (2020) and a B.A. in Political Science (summa cum laude) from Istanbul Bilgi University, with a second major in TV Reporting and Programming.

My research lies at the intersection of techno-politics, intelligence studies, and communication studies, with a particular interest in how emerging technologies—especially artificial intelligence—shape national security strategies, civil-military-intelligence relations, and the dynamics of public discourse. I am the author of Intelligence Analysis: Reproduction of Information, which examines the processes and methodologies behind intelligence production and analysis, and The Age of Techno-Political: State-Corporate Relations and the Construction of Security, which offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of digital advancements on statecraft, governance, and security.

I actively contribute to international academic dialogue, presenting my work at global conferences and engaging in comparative research on intelligence reform, the institutionalization of intelligence education, techno-populism in security policy, and digital surveillance regimes across the Global South.
